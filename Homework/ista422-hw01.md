1. What are the differences between Iaas, Paas, and Saas? 
Iaas is a machine that you are responsible for all its builded software. 
SaaS is software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer.
With PaaS, you deploy your application into an application-hosting environment provided by the cloud service vendor. Saas “lift and shift” model for migration (ex. office 365).

2. What is the Azure Service Management (ASM) deployment model? What is the Resource Manager deployment model?
zure Service Management (ASM) deployment model has been used to deploy services. RM deployment is faster because resources
can be deployed in parallel rather than sequentially as they are in ASM.

3. What is the difference between a control plane amd a data plane?
Control plane packets are destined to or locally originated by the router itself. This is really what separates the concept of the control and data plane. 

4. What is Role-Based Access Control?
control access to the resources in the group. For example, you can assign the Owner role to a user, giving that user full
administrative privileges to those resources in the group but not to other resources in the
subscription.

5. Why would you want to create a custom role for role-based access control?
to assign permissions. ex. Army S1 has different access to administrative information then an infantry soldier.

6. Consider the Azure portal. What is the dashboard? What is the hub? What is a blade?
on the center, left. a blade is another column on the left.

7. Access the conceptual Azure documentation on Github. Search the documentation and answer this question: What happens when I reach the spending limit?


8. Access the Azure samples on Github. Search for an example that will allow you to download an Azure invoice. Copy the source code to your discussion. (This is Program.cs.)


9. Access the Azure Resource Manager samples on Github. Search for a quickstart template that will allow you to set up a free SQL Database for a web application. This template has four files. One file
is a markdown file. What is the type of the other three files?
